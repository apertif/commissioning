Scripts and notebooks for commissioning

This is a common repository for working on commissiong tasks. 
The guidelines for best practices are:
- If working on existing code/notebooks, check it out and push it back when you are done actively working for the day.
- Example tutorial notebooks go directly in the commisisoning subfolder; tests run on additional multiple datasets go in the subdirectory `testing` within each commissioning folder.

The structure of this repository is: <br>
-Commissioning tasks
 -python modules for the task, tutorial notebooks 
   -testing: notebooks run on datasets to complete the commissioning tasks <br>
